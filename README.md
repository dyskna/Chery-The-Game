# CheryTheGame (Project in Progress)
> **Note:** This repository contains the full game on the `main` branch. For the **AI training setup** using PPO reinforcement learning, see the [`AI`](../../tree/AI) branch.

Chery The Game (spelling mistake on purpose) is my original adventure game that takes players on a vacation full of fruit-picking, but with an unexpected twist. The player takes on the role of someone who, during their summer vacation, decides to make money by picking ripe cherries. The task seems simple and enjoyable at first, but soon it turns out that this relaxing holiday leads to something far darker than expected…

This project was created as a learning experience for me to get familiar with the Unity engine and game development.
I am the author of all the assets used in the game, except for the amazing high res photo featured in the main menu. 
The game is in polish.
